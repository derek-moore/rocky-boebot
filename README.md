# rocky-boebot
A program that will have your Boe-Bot dancing to a popular tune from the 1980's.

My wife was kind enough to point out that the end of the song sounds wrong.  I'll wait for her pull request.

You should be able to extend this easily to play other songs by changing the music data.

Have fun!
